## What is "PatchWork Anonymous Plugin"
If you see "PatchWork Anonymous Plugin [hash]" in your plugins list, it means you have used PatchWork to install a patch which doesn't actually change code in a theme or plugin. Instead
the patch creates an Anonymous Plugin. This anonymous plugin is just like any plugin, except that it was created by PatchWork. You do not need to have PatchWork active to activate anonymous plugins. You should read the description of the plugin to find out exactly what it's function is. If you determine that you do not need the anonymous plugin anymore, you can safely deactivate and/or remove the plugin. With PatchWork active, you can also see more information including when the plugin was created and which user created it.
